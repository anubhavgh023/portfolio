		<blockquote>
			<p><strong><em>TL;DR: Pass by Value vs. Pass by Pointer in Go</em></strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong><em>Pass by Value</em></strong>: Copies the entire struct when passed to a function, causing
					performance issues for large structs.</li>
				<li><strong><em>Pass by Pointer</em></strong>: Passes a reference (pointer) to the struct, avoiding the
					overhead of copying large data.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Performance Loss</strong></em>: Pass by value starts to slow down noticeably when struct
					sizes exceed 10MB due to the memory cost of copying.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Optimal for Large Structs</strong></em>: Pass by pointer is more efficient and stable,
					especially for data sizes greater than 10MB.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Key Insight</strong>:</em> For small structs, pass by value is fine. For larger structs, use
					pass by pointer to save time and memory.

		<p>I've been diving deep into Go over the past week, exploring its features and performance characteristics.
		</p>
		<p>One of the fundamental concepts I've been examining is how Go handles data passing in
			<strong><em>functions</em></strong>, particularly with <strong><em>structs</em></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>But first, what is a even a <strong><em>struct</em></strong> ?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A struct in Go is a way to group different types of data together similar to C.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, here&#39;s a struct of 1024Mb (1Gb):</p>
		<pre><code class="language-go"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">LargeStruct</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {</span>
    data [<span class="hljs-number">1024</span> * <span class="hljs-number">1024</span> * <span class="hljs-number">1024</span>]byte <span class="hljs-comment">// 1024MB of data (1 GB)</span>
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// 1024 bytes = 1KB</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// 1024 KB = 1MB</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// 1024 MB = 1GB</span>
</code></pre>

		<h2 id="-benchmarking-pass-by-value-vs-pass-by-pointer-"><strong>Benchmarking: Pass by Value vs. Pass by
				Pointer</strong></h2>
		<p>The key question is: Should you pass <strong><em>structs</em></strong> by <em>value</em> or by <em>pointer</em>
			when performance matters?</p>
		<p>In Go, you can pass a struct to a function in two ways:</p>
		<p><strong><em>Pass by Value</em></strong>: A copy of the entire struct is made, which can be inefficient for large
			structs as it uses additional memory and processing time.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Pass by Pointer</em></strong>: Instead of passing the whole struct, you pass a pointer to it. This
			avoids copying the struct, making it more memory-efficient, especially for large data sizes.</p>
		<p><strong>The Benchmark Setup</strong></p>
		<p>To truly understand the performance difference, I designed a benchmark that compares passing large structs by
			value and by pointer. My goal was to identify when passing by value becomes inefficient as the struct size
			grows.</p>
		<hr />

		<p><strong>How Did I Benchmark?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The benchmark involves gradually increasing the struct size from 1 byte to 1GB while comparing the
				time(nanoseconds) it takes to pass these structs by value and by pointer and increasing the struct size 2x
				with each iteration.</li>
			<li>For each size, I recorded the execution time using Go’s high-precision timers and exported them to a CSV for
				visualization.</li>
		</ul>
		<pre><code class="language-go">    <span class="hljs-comment">// Run benchmarks for sizes from 1 byte to 1024MB (1 Gb)</span>

        sizeMB := float64(<span class="hljs-built_in">size</span>) / (<span class="hljs-number">1024</span> * <span class="hljs-number">1024</span>)

        <span class="hljs-comment">// Write the results to CSV (size in MB, passByValue time, passByPointer time)</span>
        writer.Write([]<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>{

            fmt.Sprintf(<span class="hljs-string">"%d"</span>, durationValue.Nanoseconds()),
            fmt.Sprintf(<span class="hljs-string">"%d"</span>, durationPointer.Nanoseconds()),
        })

        <span class="hljs-comment">// Print status to monitor progress</span>
        fmt.Printf(<span class="hljs-string">"Completed benchmark for size: %.8f MB \n"</span>, sizeMB)
    }

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Benchmarking process:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><em>Run the test</em>: Each struct size was tested for both pass-by-value and pass-by-pointer methods.</li>
			<li><em>Record the results</em>: Execution time was recorded for each size and method.</li>
			<li><em>Visualize the results</em>: The results were plotted to observe how the performance scales as the struct
				size increases using python3 &amp; matplotlib.

		<p><strong>Analyzing the Results</strong>

		</div>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>From the graph, it’s clear that passing by value starts to slow down significantly as struct sizes
					increase, <strong>especially beyond 10MB</strong>. Passing by pointer remains relatively constant, with
					only a slight increase in execution time as struct size grows.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Pass by Value: Noticeable slowdown as size increases, indicating the inefficiency due to copying larger
					data.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Pass by Pointer: More consistent and efficient, with minimal slowdown, making it ideal for larger structs.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Why Does This Happen?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>The difference stems from Go&#39;s memory management. When you pass a large struct by value, the entire
				struct is copied, which increases memory usage and processing time. With a pointer, Go only passes the
				memory address, avoiding the need to copy large amounts of data.
				<hr />

			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>For small structs, pass by value is fine and might even be preferable for simplicity.</li>
			<li>For larger structs, pass by pointer is more efficient and can save significant time and memory.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Go provides the flexibility to choose based on your performance needs, so understanding the trade-offs is crucial
		</p>
		<p><strong>System Specifications:</strong>
			The benchmarks were run on:
			<strong>OS</strong>: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS
			<strong>CPU</strong>: 13th Gen Intel i5-1340P
			<strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB
			<strong>GPU</strong>: Intel Device a7a0
		</p>
		<p>This benchmark helped me understand the importance of choosing between pass-by-value and pass-by-pointer in Go
			functions, especially when dealing with large structs!</p>
